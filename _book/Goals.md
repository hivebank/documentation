# Goals

The main goal of the project is to build out all functionality needed for a core banking system. This functionality is as follows:

- Account management
- User management
- Payments between users
- Payments between institutions
- Deposits from users
- Device management
- Security considerations
- Foreign exchange

Extended functionality is as follows:

- Loan origination
- Regulation adherence and notification
- Machine learning
- Advanced fraud detection
- Interface through many channels (USSD, SMS)

The code base will pass the relevant certifications to ensure information is secure. Regular security audits will be undertaken.  

The system will be white-label. Clients will be able to deploy the system in any chosen territory. Compliance will be ensured through the amendment of relevant modules.

## Adherence to standards

The project will enable adherence to relevant standards by adding modules to the endpoints of the system. Information entering and leaving the system will be parsed accordingly.
