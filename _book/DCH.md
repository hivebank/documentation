# DCH

**BVNK** makes use of a unique system called the Distributed Clearing House (DCH).

## Overview

The DCH is a distributed, immutable database used for the process of payments between institutions. Strong, industry standard cryptography is used to ensure validity and origin or messages.

## Use cases

Broadly, the DCH is used to send messages between financial institutions. These messages are ensured to be both valid and from the said recipients. This is achieved by using Public Key cryptography.

There are various types of messages that can be sent on the DCH:

- Payments
- Fraud alerts
- Verification requests
- Asset purchases
- Equity exchange

## Integration

**BVNK** has built in integration for the DCH. Existing financial institutions can use libraries to integrate DCH functionality into their stacks.
