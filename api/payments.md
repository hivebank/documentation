# Payments

The accountDetails value for payments is in the following form:

`accountNumber@bankNumber`

The `bankNumber` parameter is used to determine which bank the sender and recipient belong to. Currently, 
only the current deployment is supported. 

If payments are made using an account on the current deployment, the `bankNumber` parameter should be left blank:

`accountNumber@`

## Credit Transfer
HTTP route: `POST /payment/credit`

This route initiates a payment from one party to another. Currently the system only supports payments 
between account holders on that system. There is, however, scope to include this to payments on another given 
deployment of BVNK, as well as account holders at other current banking institutions.

## Transaction List
HTTP route: `GET transactions/list/{perPage}/{pageNumber}`

This route returns a list of transactions according to the parameters sent in the request. In the `GET` request,
perPage and pageNumber are sent through to list transactions. Transactions are returned per account linked to a given 
user, and the accountNumber parameter specificies which user account to return transactions for.

The order of transactions returned is from most recent. If a user wants to retrieve all transactions, they would loop through 
transactions using this route increasing pageNumber until less than perPage is returned, or if an empty set is returned.

  --url https://demo.bankai.co/transaction/list/10/0 \
