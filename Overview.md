**BVNK** is open source core banking software for the modern world. We plan to bring innovation to the financial industry through lowering barriers to entry.

The financial industry is well known for using outdated technology. A significant number of existing core systems still rely on decades old technology. This project aims to bring that infrastructure through to current technological levels.

A secondary aim of this project is to lift the curtain on the financial industry. This is one of the most closed off industries, and finding out how it works has proven to be difficult. As more information comes to light the possibilities open up. Bringing light to this industry will surely help other fintech developers and upstarts.

This projects development [is documented](http://ksred.me/tags/banking-infrastructure/).
