## Core server

The server language is Go. The core server exposes an HTTP API by default. It can also serve as a CLI API server as well as a CLI API client.

## Desktop application

The desktop framework is Electron. Bank administrators will use the desktop application to manage the deployment.

## Internet banking

Consumers will have access to secure internet banking. This will enable account management, payments, contact management (beneficiaries) and more.
